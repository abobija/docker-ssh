# docker-ssh
SSH Server Docker Image

## Usage

```
docker container run -d -p 9090:22 abobija/ssh
```

After the image has been saved and the container is started, use some SSH client to connect to `localhost:9090`.

## Demo

Check this YouTube video about how I have used Bitvise SSH Client to make connection with the Container:
